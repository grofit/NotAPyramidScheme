So if you open the solution there should be 3 folders:

- Shared (Stuff used in both application scenarios)
- AppLevelResolving (Explicit DI configuration in the application)
- ConventionResolving (Implicit conventional DI configuration in the applicaiton)

You can look over the source code in all the projects and there should be some level of documentation
on most bits as well as a readme in each application which give a breakdown of the pros/cons and hopefully
some more info on the scenario.

Also just remember that this is a simple example, so a lot of code has been made in a way to show intent
without having to hammer out lots of behaviour so dont get too hung up on some of the design patterns etc.
The crux of these examples is to look at the way DI configuration would be setup and consumed in simple and 
more complex scenarios.
